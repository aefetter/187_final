    <p>In the bustling world of employment, two distinct classifications emerge: the 1099 and W-2 workers. Each classification delineates a unique relationship between the worker and the employer, accompanied by its own set of rights, responsibilities, and tax implications. The number of 1099 contract employees is growing, injecting greater flexibility, but also precarity into the American workforce. Some of this may be due to misclassification of workers and the gig economy. Let's delve into the depths of these designations to illuminate their difference and highlight the criteria governing who should be classified as independent workers.</p>

    <p id="graph-text">Why does this matter? The amount of independent workers has risen steadily over the past decade. Much of this growth can be attributed to the growth of the gig economy. Workers who work for the rideshare and service apps are all 1099 employees. They can work on their own schedule, but they don't enjoy the same employment law or tax benefits as W-2 employees. Publicizing the difference between 1099 and W-2 employees can help prevent workers being misclassified.</p>

    <h2>What's the criteria for an employee to be considered an independent contractor?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Independence:</strong> You must have control over how, when, and where you perform your work. This means you're not under direct supervision or control of the company hiring you.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> There should be a clear contract outlining the terms of your work, including the scope of the project, payment terms, and other relevant details.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Control:</strong> You're responsible for your own expenses related to the work, and you have the opportunity for profit or loss based on your performance.</li>

        <h6>About this Project</h6>
        <p>For my final project for MEJO 187: Foundations of Interactive Media we were instructed to pick a topic of our choosing and make a single page web story using HTML/CSS/Javascript. The requirements included a title, short story introduction, embedded Flourish chart made with data from a reliable source, and an interactive feature made using javascript. This project is supposed to highlight the web design and coding skills gained throughout the semesters.</p>
        <br>
        <p> We were allowed, and even encouraged, to use artificial intelligence to help us generate the stories as well as write and debug code. I included my conversation histories as links. Just click "AI Conversations" to access these. I also included comments in my code for where I received AI help. I also used chat GPT to help with overall styling.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I chose the distinctions between W-2 and 1099 employees because it's a topic I've enjoyed learning about in my management courses. It's a simple enough topic that AI could generate clear content and I could also quickly tell if something was wrong. It's also been a topic that's been in the news a lot as the gig economy grows.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks for looking at my final project! I hope you enjoy!</p>
