    <p>In the bustling world of employment, two distinct classifications emerge: the 1099 and W-2 workers. Each classification delineates a unique relationship between the worker and the employer, accompanied by its own set of rights, responsibilities, and tax implications. The number of 1099 contract employees is growing, injecting greater flexibility, but also precarity into the American workforce. Some of this may be due to misclassification of workers and the gig economy. Let's delve into the depths of these designations to illuminate their difference and highlight the criteria governing who should be classified as independent workers.</p>

    <p id="graph-text">Why does this matter? The amount of independent workers has risen steadily over the past decade. Much of this growth can be attributed to the growth of the gig economy. Workers who work for the rideshare and service apps are all 1099 employees. They can work on their own schedule, but they don't enjoy the same employment law or tax benefits as W-2 employees. Publicizing the difference between 1099 and W-2 employees can help prevent workers being misclassified.</p>

<div id="criteria">
    <h2>What's the criteria for an employee to be considered an independent contractor?</h2>
    <p>Form 1099s is used to report non-employment income to the IRS. They can be issued to independent contractors or for dividends from stocks. Businesses are required to issue 1099s to anyone who receives at least $600 in non-employment income. The threshold for issuing 1099s is $10 for stock dividends. There's multiple types of 1099 forms. We'll focus on 1099-NEC since that's the most pertinent for independent contractors. NEC stands for non-employee compensation. Here are the three common law rules the IRS looks at to see if someone is an independent contractor. </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?</li>
        <li><strong>Financial:</strong> Are the business aspects of the workerâ€™s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Type of Relationship:</strong> Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (that is, pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Generally the answers to these questions would have to be "no" for someone to classify as an independent contractor, although there's no hard and fast rule. The IRS gives this simple guideline to help make the distinction: "The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done."</p>

        <h6>About this Project</h6>
        <p>For my final project for MEJO 187: Foundations of Interactive Media we were instructed to pick a topic of our choosing and make a single page web story using HTML/CSS/Javascript. The requirements included a title, short story introduction, embedded Flourish chart made with data from a reliable source, and an interactive feature made using javascript. This project is supposed to highlight the web design and coding skills gained throughout the semesters.</p>
        <br>
        <p> We were allowed, and even encouraged, to use artificial intelligence to help us generate the stories as well as write and debug code. I included my conversation histories as links. Just click "AI Conversations" to access these. I also included comments in my code for where I received AI help. I also used chat GPT to help with overall styling.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I chose the distinctions between W-2 and 1099 employees because it's a topic I've enjoyed learning about in my management courses. It's a simple enough topic that AI could generate clear content and I could also quickly tell if something was wrong. It's also been a topic that's been in the news a lot as the gig economy grows.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks for looking at my final project! I hope you enjoy!</p>
